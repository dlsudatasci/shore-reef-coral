description: Citizen scientists have a role not only in conducting the surveys, but also in generating data about their reefs. This video shows how images taken during Alwan surveys can be processed in a participatory manner by citizen scientists and presented to stakeholders in a simple and easily understandable format.

## Public Data Processing

One goal of citizen science is to positively shift people’s behaviors and perspectives. In order for this to happen, having citizen scientists collect the data isn’t enough. We also need to make sure that the results reach them. One way to do this is to make sure they are involved in processing the data so that they can immediately see how their reef is doing and discuss what they can do about it.

The advantage of public data processing is that it isn’t only the citizen scientists who conducted the survey who can participate. The youth, fisherfolk, people's organization (PO) leaders, government representatives, and other members of the community can also take so that they can see for themselves what is happening in the reefs they depend on.

### Butterflyfish

1. Show the images of the Alwan survey guides one by one using a laptop and TV or projector.
1. Copy the butterflyfish counts in the survey guides to the butterflyfish datasheet.
1. Once all the numbers have been copied, compute for the total, average, and range for each butterflyfish species.
1. The computed average species richness and average abundance will be used in the scorecard.

### Target marine invertebrates

1. Just like what was done for the butterflyfish, show the images of the Alwan survey guides.
1. Copy the counts of target marine invertebrates from the Alwan survey guides to the target marine invertebrates datasheet.
1. After all the numbers have been copied, compute for the average count of each target marine invertebrate.
1. The computed average of each target marine invertebrate will be used in the scorecard.

### Coral

1. Show a coral survey photo and put ten random points on the screen
   1. You can use a sheet of plastic cover or acetate with points placed in an equidistant grid.
1. Go over the points one by one and have the group decide which Reef Bottom Type should be assigned to each. Ask everyone present and record the agreed-upon Reef Bottom Type and possible Notes on the coral datasheet.
1. Repeat this process until you’ve gone through at least 30 images.
1. After recording everything, find the total of each Reef Bottom Type.
1. Compute for the relative cover of each Reef Bottom Type.
1. Hard Coral Cover is what will be used in the scorecard.

### The Alwan Scorecard

The scorecard summarizes the results of the three surveys and serves as a basis for assessing the state of the reef. One scorecard should be prepared for each station, and the team leader should verify the datasheets before the group fills out the scorecard.

1. Project the blank scorecard on a large screen. You can also write it on a cartolina or Manila paper.
   ![Writing on a survey guide](/images/lesson-8/3.jpg 'Writing on a survey guide')
1. The top portion of the scorecard is for all the important details of the survey station. Write down the following:
   1. Name of the survey station
   1. Barangay
   1. Municipality
   1. Province
   1. Survey team name
1. The right side of the scorecard is where the letter grades for each criterion will be placed. There are several columns, with each representing one survey. Write the year and month of the current survey in one column.
1. The left side of the scorecard contains the scales which act as a guide for the letter grades that can be given to each criterion. Use these scales, find the appropriate letter grade for each criterion based on the values in your datasheets and write them down in the corresponding row.
1. Discuss the results with the community.

Example:

You conducted a survey in Talim Outer A, Barangay Luyahan, Lian, Batangas and your team name is Lian Fisherfolk Association. You surveyed the reef here in May 2021.

&nbsp;

The hard coral cover is 52%. Look for the letter grade this falls under. Since the hard coral cover is greater than 44%, ‘A’ is the proper letter grade to indicate on the scorecard.

The number of butterflyfish spotted during the survey was 60. Put ‘B’ next to Butterflyfish Abundance

<div class="grid-layout-2">

The number of butterflyfish species spotted during the survey was 7. Put ‘B’ next to Butterflyfish richness.

No COTS were spotted in the survey station. ‘A’ is the letter grade in this case.

Only one giant clam was spotted. Place ‘D’ next to the Giant Clams criteria.

Only 20 feather stars were found in the station. ‘C’ is the letter grade in this case.

Only 6 Linckia were found in the station. ‘C’ is also the letter grade in this case.

If you’re conducting another survey in the same station, use the same scorecard. For example, if you were to conduct another survey in 2022, indicate the month and year and repeat the process.

&nbsp;

For example, you conducted another survey here in May 2022. Simply indicate the current year and repeat the process. This will allow you to see if the scores for each criterion have changed after a certain period of time. These changes can serve as a basis of discussion for the community and a guide for what management measures might be appropriate for your reef.
