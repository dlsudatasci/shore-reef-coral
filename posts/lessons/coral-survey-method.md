## Coral Survey Method

Reefs are made up of thousands of corals. They are probably the first animals you would spot in a reef—without them, no reefs could be formed. Hence, the health of a reef is dependent on its corals.

### The C30 Method

![Diver taking photos of corals](/images/lesson-5/1.jpg "Diver taking photos of corals")

A simple image-based method called C30 can help us measure the abundance of corals in a reef.

All you need are two citizen scientists who know how to skin dive and the following materials:
- An action camera such as a GoPro or Olympus TG6
- One folding monopod
- On navigational marker
- One Alwan survey guide with random

![Materials used for diving](/images/lesson-5/2.jpg "Materials used for diving")

The goal of the C30 method is to take 30-50 photos of the reef like the one:

![Diagram showing a 1 square-meter image](/images/lesson-5/3.jpg "Diagram showing a 1 square-meter image")

One image needs to cover one square meter of the reef.  The monopod will serve as a guide for the 1x1 square meter image area.

### Survey preparation

Before beginning the survey, divide the station into left and right halves. You can place a marker, such as a freediving buoy, in the middle of the station to mark the two halves. **The station will be surveyed one half at a time.**

![Survey station layout](/images/lesson-5/4.jpg "Survey station layout")

Assign one photographer and one navigator. The photographer will hold the monopod with an action camera attached to it, while the navigator will hold the Alwan Survey Guide with random numbers and the navigational marker.

The citizen scientists must position themselves in the center of one half of the survey station, facing the shore.

### Random numbers

To make sure that the images taken on the reef aren’t biased, the random numbers serve as a guide for the citizen scientists to determine which parts of the reef will be photographed.
 
There are two kinds of random numbers:

**The first random number indicates direction.** There are eight possible numbers indicating direction.  Number 1 is toward the left. Number 2 is toward the fourth corner buoy. Number 3 is toward the shore. Number 4 is toward the third corner buoy. Number 5 is toward the right. Number 6 is toward the second corner buoy. Number 7 is toward the deep. Number 8 is toward the starting corner buoy.

**The second random number indicates distance or meters to swim.** The citizen scientists can swim from five up to ten meters within the survey station.

For example:

The pair of random numbers for the first image is 1 and 5. From the center, the citizen scientists will face the left and swim 5 meters toward the indicated direction.

![Survey station layout](/images/lesson-5/8.jpg "Survey station layout")

From here, they will swim to the location for the second photo. If the next set of random numbers is 3 and 7, the citizen scientists will face the shore and swim 7 meters toward it.

![Survey station layout](/images/lesson-5/9.jpg "Survey station layout")

Remember, if you’re about to pass the boundaries of the survey station, swim backwards to complete the indicated distance. Imagine ‘bouncing back’ into the survey station. 

![Survey station layout](/images/lesson-5/10.jpg "Survey station layout")

Continue this process until you have **15-30 images of each half of the survey station**.

### Taking photos

Once the navigator has identified a position, they will drop the navigational marker to serve as a guide for the photographer.

![Navigational marker](/images/lesson-5/11.jpg "Navigational marker")

The photographer will face the shore and position themselves to the left of the navigational marker. The navigational marker should be the target of the photographer and should be on the right side of the monopod.

![Beach-side diving](/images/lesson-5/12.jpg "Beach-side diving")

Skin dive until the base of the monopod is a few inches away from the highest part of the reef bottom.  Open the monopod only when you’re near the reef bottom.

![Diver taking picture of corals](/images/lesson-5/13.jpg "Diver taking picture of corals")

Upon opening the monopod, look carefully at the camera screen and press the shutter button.  Wait 1-2 seconds to make sure the image was captured.

![Close up of monopod](/images/lesson-5/14.jpg "Close up of monopod")

Close the monopod and slowly swim to the surface. Remember that the navigator should watch over and wait for the photographer at all times.

### The ideal photo

The goal is to take the clearest and most accurate photo possible of the reef so that we can easily identify the different corals and other components of the reef. The processing of images will be much easier if the images are all clear and have accurate color.

![Diving team](/images/lesson-5/16.jpg "Diving team")

Remember to make sure that the camera is properly attached to the monopod and take test shots before starting the survey to avoid any problems along the way.

![Red camera](/images/lesson-5/17.jpg "Red camera")

The base of the monopod should be lined up to the bottom edge of the camera screen or frame.  There should be no blur in the image; all the details should be clear.

Because the colors can shift when you go deeper into the water, you have to adjust the camera settings to capture the right colors. This is essential for distinguishing live corals from dead or bleached corals.

### Other photos

To avoid confusion in backing up the image files, apart from the C30 photos, here are some other images you need to take:

![Sample table checklist](/images/lesson-5/18.jpg "Sample table checklist")

The **Alwan Survey Guide** with details of the survey station and the citizen scientists.

![Index finger hand signal](/images/lesson-5/20.jpg "Index finger hand signal")
![Peace sign hand symbol](/images/lesson-5/21.jpg "Peace sign hand symbol")
![Circle hand symbol](/images/lesson-5/19.jpg "Circle hand symbol")

**Hand signal ‘1’** to indicate the beginning of the photo series in the first half of the station. 

**Hand signal ‘V’** to indicate the beginning of the photo series in the second half of the station. 

**Hand signal ‘0’** to indicate the end of the survey. 

If you have any other questions about setting up the camera, don’t hesitate to ask your team leader.
