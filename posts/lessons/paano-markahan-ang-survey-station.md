## Marking the Survey Station Boundaries

Coral reefs are huge geological structures that can grow over hundreds of kilometers. It’s not feasible to survey an entire reef, so instead we survey a portion of the reef which we call the survey station. The approximate location of the survey station should be chosen in advance by the team scientist. The survey team then marks the boundaries of the survey station to ensure that all of the Alwan surveys are conducted in the same area.

## Materials

A team of at least three citizen scientists is recommended to mark the survey station boundaries. This team will need the following materials:

1. One portable GPS unit
1. Four sets of buoys with ropes
1. Five 25-meter float lines
   1. These are ropes with floats that are half a meter apart from each other. Each float line has a connector or tuna clip on one end and a float and loop on the other end.
1. One navigational marker.
   1. The navigational marker is made of PVC pipe, fishing weights, a floater, and a rope marked at five and six meters.

Make sure that these materials are ready before traveling to the survey station.

## Roles

In order to ensure that the activity goes smoothly, each team member and the boat crew should understand what their tasks and responsibilities are. It is the responsibility of the team leader to assign the roles and thoroughly explain them to the team member before traveling to the survey station.

1. Boat Crew
   1. Tasks
      1. Deploy and reel in the float lines from the boat. This helps to avoid the float lines getting tangled in the water.

1. Citizen Scientist 1
   1. Tasks 1. Look for the starting corner. 1. Pull three connected float lines from the boat to mark the long side of the survey station. 1. Deploy one float line to mark one short side of the survey station.

   1. Materials to bring
      1. One set of orange buoys
      1. Navigational marker
1. Citizen Scientist 2
   1. Tasks 1. Give instructions to the boat crew about deploying the float lines 1. Attach the three connected float lines which mark the long side of the survey station to the starting corner buoy 1. Deploy a float line to mark one short side of the survey station 1. Mark the coordinates of the starting corner and second corner buoys

   1. Materials to bring
      1. One float line
      1. One white buoy
1. Citizen Scientist 3
   1. Tasks 1. Deploy the starting corner buoy 1. Assist Citizen Scientist 1 in deploying the float lines and attaching the corner buoys
      ![Survey station overview and measurements 3](/images/lesson-3/4.jpg 'Survey station overview and measurements 3')
   1. Materials to bring
      1. One set of orange buoys
      1. One float line
      1. One white buoy
1. Citizen Scientist 4
   1. Tasks 1. Assist Citizen Scientist 2
      ![Survey station overview and measurements](/images/lesson-3/5.jpg 'Survey station overview and measurements')
   1. Materials to bring
      1. One white buoy (CS2 will no longer need to bring one)

## How to deploy float lines

1. Go to the initial random point coordinates indicated on the portable GPS.
1. Throw a buoy as close as possible to the coordinated indicated on the portable GPS. Instruct the boat to anchor near here. No one should get off the boat until the motor is off and it is securely anchored.
1. **CS1**: Begin snorkeling. Look for depth of 5-6 meters using the navigational marker. Once this depth is found, leave the navigational marker there and return to the boat and get one end of float line, with the other end held by the boat crew.

1. **CS3**: Deploy the orange starting corner buoys by swimming to the point where the navigational marker was placed and skin diving to tie the buoys to either a rock or dead coral on the reef bottom. Make sure the rope is straight and attached securely. Return to the boat to retrieve one float line, one set of orange buoys, and one buoy.

5. **CS1 and CS3**: Swim parallel to the shore until three float lines from the boat are deployed.

1. **CS2**: Once CS1 and CS3 have deployed the three float lines, attach the other end of these lines to the starting corner buoy. Return to the boat to get the remaining float line and white buoy.
1. **CS1**: After CS2 has attached the three float lines to the starting corner buoy, pull on the float lines to straighten them and look again for a depth of 5-6 meters using the navigational marker. Adjust the float lines if needed.
1. **CS3**: After CS1 finds the correct depth, skin dive to attach the second corner buoy to a dead coral or rock.
   ![Location of starting corner](/images/lesson-3/10.jpg 'Location of starting corner')
1. **CS1, CS2, and CS3**: After the three float lines marking the long side of the station are secured to the first and second corner buoys, deploy the single float lines on the short sides of the station by attaching one end to the orange buoys on the deep side and swimming towards the shore. Tie the white buoys to another rock or dead coral, then attach the other end of the single float lines to the white buoys.
   ![Location of starting corner](/images/lesson-3/11.jpg 'Location of starting corner')
1. **All citizen scientists** should return to the boat before starting the survey.
1. For added safety during the survey, you can attach a freediving buoy, lifesaver, or life jacket to the reef bottom in the center of the survey station.

## How to retrieve the float lines

After all the Alwan surveys are finished, the float lines must be retrieved.

1. Detach the float lines from the corner buoys and clip them to the other float lines. Make sure that all five float lines are attached to each other.
1. Give one end of the float lines to the boat crew. They will then reel in and organize the float lines. One citizen scientist may return to the boat to assist the boat crew with this process.

1. Carefully untie the ropes of the corner buoys from the reef bottom so as to not damage any corals. Coil the ropes as you retrieve them to avoid becoming entangled.
   ![Location of starting corner](/images/lesson-3/13.jpg 'Location of starting corner')
1. Return to the boat.
1. Properly arrange the survey equipment in a crate or dive bag to make sure they don’t get tangled before the next survey.
