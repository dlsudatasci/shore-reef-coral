## Skin Diving Safety

To conduct the coral survey method, you need to know how to skin dive a depth of 5-6 meters. While skin diving is generally safe, doing it improperly can be dangerous. In order to prevent untoward incidents in the water, there are a few safety precautions you should implement.

### Prepare a dive plan

All the citizen scientists’ designated roles and responsibilities should be clear before entering the water. Meet the day beforehand to discuss who will be skin diving and to remind the team of safety protocols.

### Team members should be healthy and well-rested before the survey

- It is possible for a skin diver to faint if they have not rested properly or were intoxicated the previous night.
- No one should skin dive if they have a cold or clogged nose. This would interfere with their ability to equalize or remove pressure from their ears while skin diving, which could cause headaches or even ruptured ear drums.

### Make sure that team members are comfortable using snorkeling equipment

- Team members should ensure that their mask, snorkel and fins fit them properly.
- Each team member should practice using their mask, snorkel, and fins before conducting the survey.
- Prevent mask fogging by applying an anti-fogging agent such as toothpaste or baby shampoo.

### Always skin dive with a buddy

- The navigator or another citizen scientist should always be monitoring the skin diver. The photographer should have reached the surface safely before anyone moves on to the next imaging spot.
- It is best if the photographer can give the "okay" sign upon surfacing to signal that they can move to the next spot.

### Follow the 1:2 dive time rule

- To avoid getting tired too quickly, getting dizzy, or fainting, make sure to take breaks between skin dives.
- The rule of thumb is to rest twice as long as your dive. For example, if your total dive time was 30 seconds, rest for at least one minute before diving again.

### Equalize early and often

- Equalizing is important to avoid headaches while you skin dive.
- Equalize as much as needed while skin diving and swimming up to the surface.
- If you are unable to equalize, do not go any deeper. Swim back to the surface and rest before trying again.

### Decide on target points before diving and surfacing

- Point your hand and arm at the target point. This will serve as your guide for direction and help you avoid hitting other people or objects while swimming.

### Relax!

- Don’t panic while you dive.
- Stay relaxed and breathe deeply before diving.
- Move slowly underwater to conserve oxygen and energy.
- If you still can’t skin dive properly, you can use something to assist you like weights attached to a weight belt.

### Have a floatation device ready

- A floatation device such as a life jacket or freediving buoy provides a way for tired citizen scientists to rest. Another option is to rent a small boat that can assist tired citizen scientists.
- You can place the floatation device in the center of the station so that there is a designated resting spot.
- Team members who do not need to skin dive can also wear or hold on to a life jacket during the survey.

&nbsp;

If any team members are inexperienced in skin diving, don’t attempt the survey without an experienced companion.

The most important thing to remember is that everyone’s safety is the first priority. Don’t hesitate to abort the survey if safety is threatened.
