## What is Citizen Science?

If you want to help our environment, especially our coral reefs, citizen science is a great way to do it. But what exactly is citizen science, and how does it differ from participatory science, volunteerism, or community-based initiatives?

## The goals of citizen science

There are already many initiatives around the world that encourage collaboration between scientists and the public, especially in environment-related studies. Generally speaking, citizen science involves the collection and analysis of data by non-scientists. Ideally, it should also move beyond this by involving citizen scientists in every step of the scientific process, from conceptualization of socially relevant research questions to application of the results.

Citizen science has three primary goals:

1. To broaden scientific knowledge through collecting data with the help of the public.
1. To use that data to establish effective policies and laws.
1. To use these learnings to shift peopleâ€™s behaviors and perspectives.

## Reef monitoring with the Alwan citizen science methods

The Alwan methods were developed to empower citizen scientists from all backgrounds to monitor their reefs. The use of the Alwan methods comes in three parts.

Firstly, citizen scientists are taught how to recognize marine creatures like corals, butterflyfish, and clams. They are also taught the different survey methods to collect data on the reef. This training can be accomplished in a day.

Next is the actual survey. One reef survey takes approximately two hours. The survey methods were developed to be simple, requiring only basic skills and materials which are commonly available in coastal communities. This is in contrast to the survey methods typically used by scientists, which require SCUBA training and expensive equipment.

Lastly, the images taken during the survey are processed in public with the help of a laptop, TV, or projector. The whole community can participate in processing these images, even those who were not able to join in the actual survey. The results of this image processing can then be reported to reef managers and the rest of the community.

In order for the results to have a meaningful impact, we need the collaboration of different sectors of society, including experts, public officials and government workers, people's organizations (POs) or various civil society organizations, and of course members of coastal communities.

By getting to know our reefs better and translating our knowledge to action, we can help them thrive for the benefit of all Filipinos and for future generations.
