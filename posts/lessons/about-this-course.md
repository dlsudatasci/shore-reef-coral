## About this course

![Survey team certified after training](/images/lesson-0/1.jpg 'Survey team certified after training')

This learning course will teach you how to conduct reef surveys using the Alwan citizen science methods. It includes basic background information about coral reefs and citizen science, detailed instructions on how to carry out the butterflyfish, target marine invertebrates, and coral surveys, and how to process the survey images.

&nbsp;

This course is open to everyone who wants to become a citizen scientist. The basic skill requirements to conduct Alwan surveys are knowing how to read, write, and skin dive â€“ but even citizen scientists who do not have all of these skills can be given important roles in the conduct of surveys and processing of data.

&nbsp;

The course consists of eight modules. The modules are intended to be viewed in order, but you may go back at any time to review. You may take the course at your own pace.

&nbsp;

Each module has a training video and text which summarizes the contents of the video. You may use one or both depending on what suits your learning style. Additional reference materials and exercises are also linked within each module, where needed.

### Disclaimer

This course is intended as a supplement, not a substitute, for training in the field facilitated by an accredited trainer. For safety reasons, do not attempt to conduct Alwan surveys without the presence of an accredited trainer.

&nbsp;

Taking this course does not certify you as an accredited trainer of the Alwan methods.
